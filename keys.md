## My set of keys that hold everything I need access to throughtout my day to day life

If I ever left my keys at home, I would not be able to return home. Simple as that. This holds my bike-lock keys, apartment keys, even home keys for when I visit my parents on occassion. The only thing that I keep seperately from this key ring are my car keys, as I keep those seperate so if I were to lose one, I would not lose absolutely everything.
